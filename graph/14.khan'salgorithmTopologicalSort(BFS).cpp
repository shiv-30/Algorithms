// A DAG G has at least one vertex with in-degree 0 and one vertex with out-degree 0.
// Proof: Thereâ€™s a simple proof to the above fact is that a DAG does not contain a cycle which means that all paths will be of finite length. Now let S be the longest path from u(source) to v(destination). Since S is the longest path there can be no incoming edge to u and no outgoing edge from v, if this situation had occurred then S would not have been the longest path
// => indegree(u) = 0 and outdegree(v) = 0

// Algorithm: Steps involved in finding the topological ordering of a DAG:
// Step-1: Compute in-degree (number of incoming edges) for each of the vertex present in the DAG and initialize the count of visited nodes as 0.

// Step-2: Pick all the vertices with in-degree as 0 and add them into a queue (Enqueue operation)

// Step-3: Remove a vertex from the queue (Dequeue operation) and then.

// Increment count of visited nodes by 1.
// Decrease in-degree by 1 for all its neighboring nodes.
// If in-degree of a neighboring nodes is reduced to zero, then add it to the queue.
// Step 5: Repeat Step 3 until the queue is empty.




// Step 5: If count of visited nodes is not equal to the number of nodes in the graph then the topological sort is not possible for the given graph.

// How to find in-degree of each node?
// There are 2 ways to calculate in-degree of every vertex:

// Take an in-degree array which will keep track of
// Traverse the array of edges and simply increase the counter of the destination node by 1.
// for each node in Nodes
//     indegree[node] = 0;
// for each edge(src, dest) in Edges
//     indegree[dest]++
// Time Complexity: O(V+E)

// Traverse the list for every node and then increment the in-degree of all the nodes connected to it by 1.
//     for each node in Nodes
//         If (list[node].size()!=0) then
//         for each dest in list
//             indegree[dest]++;
// Time Complexity: The outer for loop will be executed V number of times and the inner for loop will be executed E number of times, Thus overall time complexity is O(V+E).

// The overall time complexity of the algorithm is O(V+E)
